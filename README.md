# PyGridNode

PyGridNode helps to data owners manage their data, being the place where data lives. It is part of the [PyGrid Platform](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyGrid/):
- PyGrid.  A server based application used to manage/monitor/control and route grid Nodes/Workers remotely.
- **PyGridNode**. A server based application used to store and manage data access in a secure and private way.
- GridWorkers. Clientd based app that uses different Syft based libraries to perform federated learning (ex: syft.js, KotlinSyft, SwiftSyft).

  -h, --help                shows the help message and exit
  --id ID                   Grid node ID, e.g. --id=alice. Default is
                            os.environ.get('GRID_WS_ID', None).

  --port PORT, -p PORT      Port number of the socket.io server, e.g. --port=8777.
                            Default is os.environ.get('GRID_WS_PORT', None).

  --host HOST               Grid node host, e.g. --host=0.0.0.0.
                            Default is os.environ.get('GRID_WS_HOST','http://0.0.0.0').

  --gateway_url GATEWAY_URL Address used to join a Grid Network. This argument isoptional.
